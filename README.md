Arduino I2C for Raspberry Pi and Erlang
==========================

This is a simple wrapper around (part of) the functions of the [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) library for Raspberry Pi: it allows interaction with I2C devices. The example works with the [PiGlow](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/piglow) shield.
